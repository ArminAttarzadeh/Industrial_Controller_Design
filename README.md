# Industrial Controller Design

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and implementation of an industrial controller for an 8th order system. The primary objectives include modeling the system, designing a PID controller, and employing advanced control techniques like the Smith Predictor to manage time delays.

## Objectives

1. **System Modeling**  
   - Obtain an approximate model of the 8th order system through system recognition techniques.

2. **PID Controller Design**  
   - Design and tune a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller using various methods to achieve optimal performance.

3. **Smith Predictor Implementation**  
   - Utilize the Smith Predictor to mitigate the effects of time delays in the control system.

## Key Features

- **System Recognition**: Accurate modeling of complex systems.
- **PID Tuning Methods**: Application of multiple tuning methods for robust performance.
- **Time Delay Compensation**: Effective handling of time delays using the Smith Predictor.
